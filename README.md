# Aquarium SQL Database (WGU D427 Learning Project)

This repository contains my SQL practice and project files for WGU's **D427: Data Management - Applications** course.

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice MySQL database creation, table design, and normalization.
- Write, test, and optimize SQL queries.
- Apply data management concepts to a real-world scenario - my deep dive (no pun intended) into aquascaping.
